# Budget App (Scientific Computing with Python)

This project is a budget management application built with Python as part of the **freeCodeCamp** curriculum. It demonstrates core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), string formatting, and data visualization.

## 🚀 Features

- **Ledger Management**: Track deposits and withdrawals with automated descriptions.
- **Transfer System**: Seamlessly transfer funds between different categories (e.g., Food to Clothing).
- **Balance Tracking**: Real-time balance calculation and fund verification.
- **Visual Receipt**: Custom string representation of categories formatted as a neat receipt.
- **Spend Chart**: A text-based bar chart that visualizes the percentage of total spending across all categories.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Python Classes & Methods**: Creating reusable objects with specific behaviors.
- **String Manipulation**: Using f-strings and padding for precise table-like layouts.
- **Logic & Math**: Calculating percentages and rounding down to the nearest 10 for graphical representation.
